# Course Materials

The following resources are required for successful completion of the Code Fellows' dev accelerator
in python.


## Code School ($19/mo)

As web developers, you'll need to know how to perform some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript
coding as well as an understanding of the client side tools available to you. Instead of 
rehashing this material, we'll ask you to complete various modules at Code School. Ths 
subscription rate is $19/mo if you use the Code Fellows discount link (posted in the Canvas
announcements).


## Meetup Fees (~$10/meetup)

Meetups are great ways to connect with professional developers in the community. We'll ask
that you attend 1 or 2 revelent meetups in the Seattle area. Some meetups do require a small
fee to help pay for food/drink and we'd like you to budget $10/meetup. Depending on the sponsors,
you may not pay anything to attend a meetup.


## DNS Name (varies but roughly $10/yr for .com)

Using a custom domain name for your portfolio site or projects is a great way to make a memorial
impression and show a basic understanding of Internet architecture. You should have at least one
domain name for hosting your portfolio projects. There are a number of DNS providers including:

    * easydns.com
    * hover.com
    * dnsimple.com
    * namecheap.com
